This is a quick reference collection of UAV drone rules and regulations and special notes in different countries for drone enthusiats going to fly overseas, for recreational purpose. However, all information provided here is subject to change. Check from official sources before flying.

## General
Be aware of NFZ or No-Fly-Zones. Most NFZ are aerodromes, usually 5km around an airport. Flying in some national parks or nature reserves are also not allowed. Private properties, and military bases are definitely to be avoided. Use a drone map mobile app to check for areas where you can fly. Look out for "No Drones" signs when on location. It is recommended that you ask the locals for permission.

Check for local drone registration requirements and flying restrictions before entering the country.

Special permits may be required for commercial flights.
