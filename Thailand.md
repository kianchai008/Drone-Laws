## Notes

Legally speaking, you are required to register your drone with Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand(CAAT) and National Broadcasting and Telecommunication Commission (NBTC) regardless of your drone weight when flying in Thailand. So even DJI Mini series also need to be registered. 

You also need third party insurance. You can obtain the insurance from this company drones@feic-asia.com. They also offer drone registration service as well. So you might want to check with them before doing your own registration with NBTC & CAAT.

Registration links for NBTC https://anyregis.nbtc.go.th and CAAT https://uav.caat.or.th/. The websites is in Thai so you have to translate it. 

As for rules and regulation in Thailand you can check out the details here https://uav.caat.or.th/vtr1_detail2.php.  Most temple also don't allow drone flying unless you have permission from them.

However, I have seen online that tourist do bring their drones into Thailand without doing those registration above and they manage to clear the airports without any issue. But this should only be done at your own risk as some have experience their drone being confiscated when flying into Bangkok.
